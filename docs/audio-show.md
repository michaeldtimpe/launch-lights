# Audio show — pipeline, scenes, effects, control panel

`--source audio` turns the Launchpad into a microphone-driven, beat-aware
visualizer. `--source webcam-show` reuses the same effect stack on a
webcam feed instead of generating scenes from audio. Both expose a
WebSocket-driven control panel when `--control-port` is set.

## Audio analysis pipeline

Per render tick (30 fps default):

1. **Capture.** A `sounddevice` callback fills a 1024-sample float32
   buffer at 44.1 kHz on a background thread.
2. **FFT band magnitudes.** Hanning-windowed `rfft`. Eight log-spaced
   bands between **40 Hz and 16 kHz** — band magnitude is the **max**
   of the bins inside the band (peak-per-band, not mean — preserves
   transients in the wider high bands).
3. **Focus weighting.** If `focus = bass / melody / harmony`, multiply
   the bands by a fixed weight profile before normalisation.
4. **Auto-gain.** A slow-decaying running max (`MAX_DECAY = 0.9985`)
   normalises the peak band to 1.0. **Stuck-rescue**: if the peak stays
   below 25 % of the running max for > 2 s (e.g. after a clap), an
   extra `× 0.99` decay accelerates recovery.
5. **Peak decay.** `held = max(new, held * bar_decay)` (`bar_decay`
   defaults to 0.85; tunable from the panel). Stops the bars from
   strobing.
6. **Beat detection.** EMA over the instantaneous bass band; a beat
   fires when `bass_now > 1.35 × ema` with a 250 ms cooldown (caps
   reported BPM at 240). Median of the last 8 inter-beat intervals is
   the BPM estimate, hard-capped at 200. Confidence comes from
   `1 - std/mean` of those intervals.
7. **Higher-level features**:
   - `beat_phase` — continuous 0..1 progress to the next expected beat.
   - `onset_strength` — log-scaled `bass_now / ema` for proportional
     reactions (weak hat vs. massive kick).
   - `spectral_flux` — sum of positive frame-to-frame band increases.
     Good signal for director scene-cuts and palette flips.
   - `beat_confidence` — interval-variance based, 0..1.

All of the above lands in a `MusicState` dataclass passed to every scene
and effect.

## Scenes (20 rotating)

Each scene maps `MusicState → sparse {Cell: RGB}`. Auto-rotate cycles
through these every 20–40 s, optionally with a secondary scene blended
and 0–2 random effects layered.

| name           | what it looks like                                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spectrum`     | bottom-up VU bars, green→yellow→red per row                |
| `inverted`     | bars hang from top, hue per column                          |
| `mirror`       | bars grow up *and* down from the middle row                 |
| `ring`         | square ring expanding from centre, size = RMS              |
| `blob`         | solid centred square pulses with bass                       |
| `rain`         | random pads spawn at top and fall; density tied to bass     |
| `sparkle`      | random pads pop on each beat and fade                       |
| `neg_sparkle`  | full grid lit; random pads go **dark** on beats             |
| `flood`        | whole grid one colour; brightness = RMS, hue jumps on beat |
| `diag`         | diagonal stripe scrolling; speed scales with BPM            |
| `rings`        | concentric rings expand from centre on beat                 |
| `col_sweep`    | bright column scans left→right, height = bass               |
| `row_sweep`    | bright row scrolls top→bottom                               |
| `checker`      | 2-colour checkerboard, phase flips on beat                  |
| `plasma`       | animated sinusoidal field, hue mapped                       |
| `border`       | pad with trail runs along perimeter, speed = BPM           |
| `cross`        | X across grid, brightness = RMS                             |
| `heart`        | heart shape that pulses with bass                           |
| `edge`         | top + bottom rows show band intensities                     |
| `quads`        | four quadrants, each filled by a band range                 |

## Special scenes (panel-only)

- `text` — scrolling banner, set from the panel's text card
  (5×7 / 3×5 fonts, left/right scroll, speed slider).
- `shape` — single static bitmap pulse, picked from the shapes & emojis
  card. Includes 5×5 mini variants.
- `blackout` — empty grid (used internally by the `clear` button and
  scene = `none`).

## Effect pipeline (fixed order)

After the scene + mutators have produced a `CellMap`:

```
trail_decay  → palette_remap → hue_rotate → invert → complementary
            → mirror → contrast → brightness → gamma
```

- **`trail_decay`** (0..0.95) — `max(current, prev * decay)` per pad.
  Adds "ghost" trails to any scene.
- **`palette_remap`** — if a palette is active, replace each lit pad
  with `palette.sample((r+g+b)/(3*63))` (brightness-keyed lookup).
- **`hue_rotate`** (-180°..+180°) — HSV rotation applied per pad.
- **`invert`** / **`complementary`** — toggles. Invert swaps lit/dark
  pads to a fixed bright fg; complementary is 180° hue, brightness
  preserved.
- **`mirror`** — `off / horizontal / vertical / quad / radial`. Radial
  is the kaleidoscope: take the top-left 4×4, mirror into all four
  quadrants.
- **`contrast`** (0.5..2.5, sigmoid) — `(x-0.5)*contrast + 0.5` clamped.
- **`brightness`** (0.1..1.5) — linear scalar.
- **`gamma`** (1.0..3.0) — perceptual correction LUT, regenerated when
  the value changes.

## Palettes

17 palettes total, all pre-rendered as 256-entry RGB LUTs at startup
(~9 kB total).

`neon`, `fire`, `inferno`, `ocean`, `forest`, `sunset`, `ice`, `candy`,
`lava`, `spring`, `mono`, `mono_red`, `mono_blu`, `violet`, `synthwave`,
`cyberpunk`, `toxic`.

Palettes are sampled by brightness — they don't pick at random. A scene
that already produces hue-varying output still produces hue-varying
output; the palette just remaps each output colour by its luminance.

## Web control panel

When `--control-port PORT` is set with `--source audio` or
`--source webcam-show`, the server listens on `127.0.0.1:PORT` and
serves three things:

- `GET /` — the control panel HTML (single-page, no build step)
- `GET /static/InterVariable.ttf` — bundled font
- `WS /ws` — live state push + command channel

## Architecture notes

- `audio_source.AudioSource` owns mic capture + the analyzer + the
  `Show` director. Its `read_frame(elapsed)` is what the scheduler
  calls each tick.
- `audio_show.Show` is the director: picks a primary scene, blends
  optional secondaries + mutators, then runs the fixed effect pipeline
  above. Live setters (`set_palette`, `set_hue`, etc.) are atomic — no
  locks needed.
- `audio_show.Show.paint_passthrough(cells, state)` is used by
  `--source webcam-show`: it skips scene generation and runs an input
  `CellMap` through the same post-stack.
- `web.server.ControlServer` runs the HTTP+WS pair on a background
  thread with its own asyncio loop. The `_apply` dispatch routes WS
  commands into either `AudioSource` setters (analysis tunables) or
  `Show` setters (effect/scene tunables).
